#SendGrid UI / Web Developer Challenge

We want to see your amazing UI development skills in action!  Please take 2 hours or less to complete this fun code challenge:

### Steps to get going

* Check out the included UI design (Sketch or PDF formats are included) that we’d like to see you implement. Implement the 'Sign Up (free)' form only. You can download [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) free for 30 days.

* Use rbenv or rvm to install Ruby 2.2.2

* Check out [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/forms.html) for an example interaction on the input fields.

* Get the Rails app running on your computer and work your magic to bring our Sketch file to life!

### When you're done
Please email us a zip file containing all the folders in your Github project.  Or, if you don’t mind it being public, you can fork it to your own repo and email us the link.

We can’t wait to see your work!
